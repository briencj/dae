<h2>Divides a factor into several individual factors</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Takes a factor and divides it into several individual factors as 
if the levels in the combined factor correspond to the numbering of the levels 
combinations of the individual factors when these are arranged in standard or 
Yates order.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>fac.divide(combined.factor, factor.names, order="standard")</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>combined.factor</code></td>
<td>
A factor that is to be divided into the individual 
factors listed in factor.names.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>factor.names</code></td>
<td>
A list of factors to be formed. The names in the list are 
the names of the factors and the component of a name is either a) a 
single numeric value that is the number of levels, b) a 
numeric vector that contains the levels of the factor, or 
c) a character vector that contains the labels of the 
levels of the factor.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
The order in which the levels combinations of the factors in 
factor.names are to be considered as numbered; standard numbers them 
as if they are arranged in standard order, that is with the first factor 
moving slowest and the last factor moving fastest; yates numbers them 
as if they are arranged in Yates order, that is with the first factor 
moving fastest and last factor moving slowest.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A data frame whose columns consist of the factors listed in 
<code>factor.names</code> and whose values have been computed from the combined 
factor. All the factors will be of the same length.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
A single factor name may be supplied in the list in which case a data 
frame is produced that contains the single factor computed from the 
numeric vector. This may be particularly useful when calling this function 
from others.
