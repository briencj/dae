<h2>Generate all combinations of several factors.</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Generate all combinations of several factors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>fac.gen(generate, each=1, times=1, order="standard")</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>generate</code></td>
<td>
list named objects and numbers that specify the factors whose 
levels are to be generated and the pattern in these levels.
If a component of the list is named, then the component 
should be either a) a single numeric value that is the 
number of levels, b) a numeric vector that contains the 
levels of the factor, or c) a character vector that 
contains the labels of the levels of the factor.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>each</code></td>
<td>
the number of times to replicate consecutively the elements of the 
levels generated according to pattern specified by the 
<code>generate</code> argument.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>times</code></td>
<td>
the number of times to repeat the whole generated pattern of 
levels generated according to pattern specified by the 
<code>generate</code> argument.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
Either <code>standard</code> or <code>yates</code>. The order in which the 
speed of cycling through the levels is to move;
combinations of the factors are to be considered as numbered; 
<code>standard</code> cycles through the levels of the first 
factor slowest and the last factor moving fastest; 
<code>yates</code> cycles through the levels of the first factor 
fastest and last factor moving slowest.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The levels of each factor are generated in a hierarchical pattern where
the levels of one factor are held constant while those of the adjacent 
factor are cycled through the complete set once. If a number is supplied 
instead of a name, the pattern is generated as if a factor with that 
number of levels had been supplied in the same position as the number. 
However, no levels are stored for this unamed factor.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A data frame of generated levels with columns corresponding to the 
factors in the <code>generate</code> list.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
Avoid using factor names F and T as these can get confused
with FALSE and TRUE.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
mp &lt;- c("-", "+")
fnames &lt;- list(Catal = mp, Temp = mp, Press = mp, Conc = mp)
Fac4Proc.Treats &lt;- fac.gen(generate = fnames, order="yates")

gen &lt;- list(A = 3, 3, B = c(0,100,200), 4, D = c("0","1"))
fac.gen(gen, times=2, each=2)
