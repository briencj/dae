<h2>Combines several factors into one</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Combines several factors into one whose levels are the combinations 
of the used levels of the individual factors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>fac.combine(factors, order="standard", combine.levels=FALSE, sep=",")</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>factors</code></td>
<td>
A list of factors all of the same length.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
The order in which the levels combinations of the factors are to 
be considered as numbered when forming the levels of the combined factor; 
standard numbers them as if they are arranged in 
standard order, that is with the first factor moving slowest and the last 
factor moving fastest; yates numbers them as if they are arranged in Yates 
order, that is with the first factor moving fastest and last factor moving 
slowest.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>combine.levels</code></td>
<td>
A logical specifying whether the levels labels of the new factor 
are to be combined from those of the factors being combined. The default is to 
use the integers from 1 to the product of the numbers of combinations 
of used levels of the individual factors.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>
A character string to separate the levels when combine.levels=TRUE.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A factor whose levels are formed form the observed combinations of the levels 
of the individual factors.</p>
